### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was a favorite because I was able to use math and equations
    in coding like I have never done before. It was something very new to me
    and how everything was calculated was much different than what I was used
    to in regular math. I was able to write functions that can calculate the
    days between two dates you put to your desire.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was a favorite of mine because it was a really creative lab
    where I was able to write functions where the user can input their own
    sandwich and it will list what their sandwich order is. It is something
    that you wouldn’t normally do which is cool to me.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was my most favorite because we used loops to make cool
    patterns and it was really fun to use the loop function to make patterns
    that I didn’t think we were able to make. I had the most excitement with
    this part when I was able to get the right pattern down.
